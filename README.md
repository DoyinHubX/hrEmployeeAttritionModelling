## **Intro**

In today's competitive business environment, organizations face significant challenges in retaining top talent. High employee attrition not only disrupts operations but also incurs substantial costs related to hiring and training new staff. According to a study published in MDPI, the average cost-per-hire for a new employee is approximately $4,129, underscoring the financial impact of employee turnover.

In this guide, we'll develop a predictive machine learning model to estimate the likelihood of employee retention in the face of attrition. By taking a predictive approach, we aim to identify the key factors influencing attrition and offer actionable insights to improve employee retention.

## **Guide Objectives**

âœ… Unravel factors influencing employee dynamics,â€Š-â€Šincluding retention, performance, and attrition.
âœ… Build a machine learning model to predict employee attrition using relevant features.
âœ… Apply techniques like SMOTE and weighted distributions to manage imbalanced datasets effectively.
âœ… Use GridSearchCV to fine-tune hyperparameters and enhance model performance.
âœ… Compare the base model's performance with Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting.
